## Business Model Overview

### Core Philosophy

**"Pay for convenience, not core functionality"** + **"Network effects drive growth"**

LockItIn's business strategy has two phases:

**Phase 1 (Year 1 - 2026):** Consumer-focused freemium app for friend groups
- Free tier with meaningful limits (3 groups max)
- Premium subscriptions ($4.99/mo or $39.99/year)
- Network effects & virality as primary growth driver

**Phase 2 (Year 2+ - 2027+):** B2B expansion with business event discovery
- "Discover" tab for local business events
- Tiered business subscriptions ($29-$199/month)
- Hybrid revenue model (consumer + B2B)

### Why This Model Works

1. **Network effects are built-in** - The app requires friends to use it, naturally driving growth
2. **Freemium drives adoption** - Free tier is genuinely useful, not a crippled trial
3. **Premium for power users** - Group organizers naturally want unlimited groups
4. **B2B revenue potential** - Local events create secondary revenue stream worth $6K+/month per city

---

## Consumer Monetization Strategy

### Free Tier - "Shareless"

**Price: $0/month**

- Use event templates (Surprise Birthday, Potluck)
- Basic notifications
- Travel time calculations
- Group availability heatmap
- "Find best times" suggestions

#### Why This Works

- Most people are in 2-3 active friend groups

---

### Pricing Strategy

#### Why $4.99/Month Works

**Lower than competitors:**
- Calendly: $12/month
- TimeTree Premium: $6.99/month
- Doodle Premium: $6.95/month
- **LockItIn: 30-60% cheaper**

**Comparable to other utility apps:**
- Apple iCloud (50GB): $0.99/month
- Spotify: $10.99/month
- Netflix (basic): $6.99/month
- **LockItIn is in the "reasonable utility" price range**

**Annual discount drives commitment:**
- $39.99/year = $3.33/month (33% off)
- Drives higher retention
- Better cash flow for company

#### Payment & Subscription Setup

**Apple In-App Purchases (Required for iOS):**

Apple's commission structure:
- Year 1: 30% commission
- Year 2+: 15% commission (for retained subscribers)

Your actual revenue:
```
Monthly subscription ($4.99):
├─ User pays: $4.99
├─ Apple takes: $1.50 (30%)
└─ You receive: $3.49

Annual subscription ($39.99):
├─ User pays: $39.99
├─ Apple takes: $12.00 (30% year 1)
└─ You receive: $27.99

After Year 2 (same subscriber):
├─ Apple takes: $0.75 (15%)
└─ You receive: $4.24
```

**Note:** This is why annual pricing is better for you!

---

### Alternative Revenue Streams

#### 1. Lifetime Premium ($99 one-time)

**Why people buy it:**
- No recurring charges
- "Support indie developer" appeal
- Early adopter badge/status
- Perceived savings over time

**When to offer:**
- Launch week special (first 500 users)
- Black Friday / Cyber Monday
- App anniversary celebrations
- Milestone celebrations (10k users, etc.)

**Revenue impact:**
```
If 100 people buy lifetime in Year 1:
= $9,900 upfront cash
= Equivalent to 166 months of subscriptions
= Helps with early cash flow
```

---

#### 2. In-App Tips / Pay What You Want

**Tipping options:**
- $1 - "Buy me a coffee"
- $3 - "Love the app!"
- $5 - "Thanks for saving me time!"
- $10 - "You're awesome!"
- Custom amount

**Why this works:**
- Low friction (one-tap)
- Feels good to support indie dev
- No commitment (one-time)
- Surprisingly effective (1-2% of engaged users)

**When to prompt:**
- After successful group event
- After app anniversary
- In "About" or "Support Developer" section
- Never intrusive or aggressive

**Potential revenue:**
```
If 1% of 10,000 users tip $5 average:
= 100 tips × $5
= $500 extra
```

---

#### 3. Group Premium (Future - Year 2)

**Price: $9.99/month**

**For the "organizer" in friend groups**

Upgrades ONE group with:
- Unlimited members (vs 25 free limit)
- Admin tools (roles, permissions)
- Analytics (who votes most, attendance stats)
- Custom group branding
- Priority in "Find Best Times" algorithm
- Export group event history

**When this makes sense:**
- Large friend groups (25+ people)
- Extended family groups
- Club/organization coordination
- Sports team management

**Market:**
- Smaller but higher willingness to pay
- "I'll pay so the group doesn't have to" psychology

**Timing:** Year 2 (2026) if there's demand

---

#### 4. Affiliate Revenue (Year 2+, Optional)

**Example: Travel event suggestions**

```
Planning a group trip to Austin?

Suggested hotels:
├─ Hotel A - $120/night (4.5 stars)
├─ Hotel B - $95/night (4 stars)
└─ [See more on Booking.com]
   (Affiliate link - we may earn a commission)
```

**Rules to keep it ethical:**
- Only relevant to event types (trips, dining, activities)
- Clearly labeled as affiliate links
- Never intrusive or spammy
- Always optional and helpful
- Premium feature only (not in free tier)
- Never sell user data
- Never track users for ads

**Potential revenue:**
- Low but passive income
- $100-500/month at 50,000+ user scale
- Not worth building until significant scale

---

### What NOT to Do

#### 1. Ads (Never)
- Banner ads
- Interstitial ads
- Video ads
- Sponsored content in feed

**Why:** Ruins UX, generates pennies, makes app feel cheap, contradicts privacy-first brand

#### 2. Selling User Data (Never Ever)
**Why:** You're a privacy-first app. Destroys trust and brand positioning.

#### 3. Pay-Per-Event (Never)
- "$0.99 to create a proposal"
- "$0.49 to vote"
- Credits system

**Why:** Nickel-and-diming creates mental burden every time they use the app

#### 4. Aggressive Upselling (Never)
- Constant "Upgrade to Premium!" popups
- Blocking features mid-use with paywall
- Fake scarcity ("Only 3 spots left!")
- Dark patterns

**Why:** Annoying, breaks free tier experience, drives uninstalls

---

### The Right Way to Prompt Upgrades

#### Gentle, Contextual Prompts

**Example 1: When hitting 3-group limit**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ You've reached your group limit     │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Free: 3 groups                      │
│ Plus: Unlimited groups              │
│                                     │
│ You're organizing a lot! Consider   │
│ upgrading to manage more groups.    │
│                                     │

### Free Trial Strategy

**7-day free trial for Premium**

**Why this works:**
- Users experience premium features risk-free
- No payment required to start
- 20-30% of trial users convert to paying
- Industry standard expectation

**When to offer trial:**
- When tapping any premium feature
- After 3rd successful event created (engaged user)
- When hitting 3-group limit

**When NOT to offer:**
- Not immediately on signup (too early)
- Not after 1st event (not engaged enough)

**Trial conversion optimization:**
- Send reminder 2 days before trial ends
- Highlight features they used during trial
- Show stats ("You organized 5 events this week!")
- Make cancellation easy (builds trust)

---

### Conversion Optimization

#### How to Get Users to Upgrade

**1. Make free tier genuinely good**
- If free sucks, people uninstall before considering premium
- If free is great, they stick around and eventually upgrade

**2. Show value before asking for money**
- Let them create 2-3 successful events first
- Let them experience the app working well
- Let them see the benefit to their friend group
- THEN suggest premium when they're engaged

**3. Highlight specific premium features contextually**
- When creating 4th group: "Upgrade for unlimited groups"
- When viewing availability: "See 4 weeks ahead with Premium"
- When scheduling recurring: "Set patterns with Premium"
- Never generic "Upgrade now!" - always contextual

**4. Social proof**
```

---

### Consumer Monetization Roadmap

#### Year 1 (2026) - Keep It Simple

**Primary revenue:** Freemium subscriptions
- Free tier: 3 groups, all core features
- Premium tier: $4.99/month or $39.99/year
- 7-day free trial
- Target: 8-12% conversion rate

**Launch specials:**
- Lifetime Premium: $99 (first 500 users)
- Launch week: 14-day trial instead of 7

**Optional (low priority):**
- In-app tips: $1-10
- Charitable donations (1% of revenue to cause)

**Avoid in Year 1:**
- Ads
- Affiliate links
- Group Premium tier
- Multiple subscription tiers

---

#### Year 2 (2026) - If Successful

**Add if there's demand:**
- Group Premium tier: $9.99/month
- Family plan: 5 accounts for $14.99/month
- Referral bonuses: 1 free month per successful referral
- Gift subscriptions: Give Premium to friends

**Maybe explore:**
- Light affiliate revenue (trips, dining) - premium only
- Branded event templates (sponsored, but tasteful)
- Business event pages (if businesses ask)

**Still avoid:**
- Ads (never)
- Selling data (never)
- Aggressive upselling

---

## B2B Expansion Strategy

### The Concept: "Discover" Tab

**Phase Launch:** 6-12 months post-consumer launch (likely mid-2026)

**Separate "Discover" or "Local Events" tab that shows:**
- Public events from verified businesses/venues
- Sorted by date (soonest first)
- Location-based (events near you)
- Conflict indicator if it clashes with your calendar
- RSVP directly from the app

**This transforms LockItIn from:**
- "Coordinate with friends" → "Coordinate with friends AND discover things to do together"

---

### Why B2B Could Be Powerful

1. **Solves the "what should we do?" problem**
   - Groups know WHEN they're free but not WHAT to do
   - LockItIn becomes the discovery layer

2. **New revenue stream**
   - B2B money is bigger than consumer subscriptions
   - $6K+/month potential per city

3. **Network effects**
   - More events = more reasons to open app
   - More users = more attractive to businesses

4. **Local discovery is trending**
   - People want alternatives to Instagram/Facebook for finding things to do

---

### User Experience

#### The Discover Tab

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📍 Huntsville, AL         [Filter] │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │
│ │ 🎸 Live Jazz Night              │ │

│ │ ⚠️ CONFLICT: Game Night         │ │
│ │ [RSVP]                          │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
│ ┌─────────────────────────────────┐ │

│ │ [RSVP]                          │ │
│ └─────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Conflict Specificity

- "⚠️ CONFLICT: Game Night" (group event)
- "⚠️ CONFLICT: Dentist" (personal, if not private)
- "⚠️ CONFLICT: Busy" (if event is marked private)

#### Filters

- Date range (this weekend, next week, etc.)
- Category (music, food, fitness, art, etc.)
- Distance (5mi, 10mi, 25mi)
- Hide conflicts (only show events I'm free for)
- Free events only

---

### RSVP Flow

#### Solo RSVP

1. Tap event → See details (description, location, capacity, price if any)
2. Tap "RSVP" → Added to your personal calendar
3. Optional: "Invite friends?" → Share to a group

#### Group RSVP (The Magic)

1. Tap event → "Propose to group"
2. Select which friend group
3. Creates a proposal with this event as an option
4. Group votes as normal
5. If confirmed, everyone's RSVP'd

**This is where LockItIn wins over Eventbrite/Facebook Events** - it's not just "I'm going," it's "let's all go together."

---

### Business Verification

**Why verify?**
- Prevents spam/fake events
- Builds user trust
- Justifies charging businesses

#### Verification Options

| Method | How it works | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| Manual review | Business submits application, you review | High quality, catches fakes | Doesn't scale, slow |
| Stripe Identity | Verify business via Stripe's KYB | Automated, legit businesses only | Costs money per verification |
| Social proof | Require linked Instagram/Facebook | Easy, free | Followers ≠ legitimate |
| Payment as verification | Must pay to post | Simple, immediate | Might block small legit businesses |
| Invite-only | You personally onboard businesses | High quality, relationship-building | Very slow |

#### Recommended Hybrid Approach

**Phase 1 (MVP):** Manual/Invite-only
- You reach out to local venues
- Personal onboarding, build relationships
- Learn what businesses need before building automation

**Phase 2 (Scale):** Payment + Light Verification
- Business signs up, enters basic info (name, address, website, EIN optional)
- Pays subscription → gets verified badge
- You spot-check periodically
- Payment itself filters out most spam

**Phase 3 (Later):** Automated Verification
- Integrate Stripe Identity or similar for instant KYB
- Auto-approve businesses that pass
- Manual review queue for edge cases

---

### Business Pricing

#### Why Standard Pricing Doesn't Work

Businesses shouldn't pay $3.99/month like consumers. They're using this for promotion and revenue.

#### Recommended Tier Structure

| Tier | Price | Events/Month | Features |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $29/month | 5 events | Basic listing, RSVP tracking |
| **Growth** | $79/month | 20 events | + Featured placement, analytics, promo tools |
| **Unlimited** | $199/month | Unlimited | + Priority support, API access, multi-location |

**Annual discount:** 2 months free (same as consumer)

#### Why These Prices?

- $29/month is accessible for a coffee shop doing weekly open mics
- $79/month is reasonable for a bar/venue doing multiple events per week
- $199/month is for serious venues where this is a real marketing channel

**For comparison:**
- Eventbrite takes ~2-3% + $0.79 per ticket
- Facebook Events is free (but dying)
- Most local event platforms charge $50-200/month

---

### What Businesses Get

#### Starter ($29/month)

- Verified business badge
- Post up to 5 events/month
- Basic event page (description, photos, location, time)
- RSVP tracking (see who's coming)
- Appear in Discover tab for local users

#### Growth ($79/month)

- Everything in Starter
- 20 events/month
- Featured placement in Discover (boosted visibility)
- Analytics dashboard (views, RSVPs, demographics)
- "Promote to groups" - suggest event to relevant groups (opt-in by users)
- Category spotlight (e.g., "Top Music Events This Week")

#### Unlimited ($199/month)

- Everything in Growth
- Unlimited events
- Multi-location support (chain businesses)
- Priority support
- API access (sync with their existing event system)
- Custom branding on event pages
- Early access to new features

---

### Revenue Potential

Let's say you get 100 local businesses in Huntsville:

- 60 on Starter: 60 × $29 = $1,740/month
- 30 on Growth: 30 × $79 = $2,370/month
- 10 on Unlimited: 10 × $199 = $1,990/month

**Total: ~$6,100/month from one city.**

Scale to 10 cities? That's $60K/month.

---

### Launch Sequence for B2B

#### Phase 1: Consumer Launch (April 2026)
- No business features
- Focus 100% on friend group coordination
- Build user base organically
- Track where users are concentrated (by city/region)

#### Phase 2: Data Collection (Months 1-6 post-launch)
- Monitor user signups by location
- See which cities hit critical mass
- Define "critical mass" = 500+ active users in a metro area

#### Phase 3: Business Beta (When a city hits threshold)
- Reach out to businesses in top 1-2 cities
- Offer free/discounted beta access
- Learn what they need, refine the product
- Get testimonials and case studies

#### Phase 4: Business Launch (Maybe 6-12 months post-consumer launch)
- Roll out paid business tiers
- Expand city by city based on user density
- Marketing: "LockItIn now has 10,000 users in Austin. Want them to discover your events?"

---

### Build Now vs Later

| Feature | MVP (April 2026) | V2 (Business Launch) |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| User location tracking | ✓ Basic (city on signup) | Enhanced analytics |
| Discover tab | ❌ | ✓ Full build |
| Business accounts | ❌ | ✓ |
| Business verification | ❌ | ✓ |
| Business pricing/billing | ❌ | ✓ |
| Conflict detection with public events | ❌ | ✓ |
| "Propose to group" from Discover | ❌ | ✓ |

**For MVP:** Just capture location data. That's it. No Discover UI, no business features. Quietly track where users are so you know when/where to expand.

---

### Threshold for Business Launch

When do you flip the switch for a city?

| Metric | Threshold | Reasoning |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Registered users | 500+ | Enough eyeballs to matter |
| Monthly active users | 200+ | Actually using the app |
| Groups created | 50+ | Active coordination happening |
| Events per month | 100+ | High engagement |

**Recommendation:** 200-500+ MAU in a metro area as the trigger. That's enough that a business posting an event will actually get seen by real people.

---

### Huntsville as Test Market?

**You're in Huntsville. That's an advantage.**

**Pros of starting local:**
- You know the venues personally
- Can do in-person onboarding
- Small enough to get meaningful penetration
- Big enough to have real businesses

**Potential play:**
1. Launch consumer app nationally (April 2026)
2. Simultaneously do a hyper-local Huntsville push
3. If Huntsville hits critical mass first (likely), use it as business beta market
4. Prove the model works, then expand

**"Huntsville is where LockItIn launched business events. Here's how it went..."** - great story for press and investor pitches.

---

## Virality Mechanics

### The Core Truth

**LockItIn has built-in virality potential because it's useless alone.**

This is actually a strength. Unlike a notes app or fitness tracker where you can use it solo forever, LockItIn *requires* you to invite friends to get value. That's a natural growth loop.

---

### What Makes People Share/Invite?

| Trigger | Example | Strength |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Functional necessity** | "I need my friends on this to plan our trip" | Very strong - they MUST invite |
| **Social proof** | "All my friends use this" | Strong - FOMO |
| **Shareable moments** | Year-End Wrapped, event memories | Medium - optional but fun |
| **Incentives** | "Invite 3 friends, get premium free" | Medium - feels transactional |
| **Wow factor** | "Look at this cool feature" | Weak alone, helps with above |

---

### LockItIn's Natural Viral Loops

#### Loop 1: The Group Creation Loop

User downloads → Creates group → Must invite friends → Friends download → They create groups → Invite THEIR friends → ...

This is your core loop. Every new user potentially brings 5-10 more.

**How to optimize:**
- Make inviting frictionless (one tap → share sheet)
- Make the invite preview compelling
- Get users to create a group during onboarding, not later

---

#### Loop 2: The Event Invite Loop

User creates event → Invites non-users → They download to RSVP → Now they're in the ecosystem

Even lighter than groups. One event can pull people in.

**How to optimize:**
- Event invite preview shows enough detail to be enticing
- RSVP requires app (don't let them RSVP from web)
- After RSVP, prompt: "Want to see when your friends are free? Create a group"

---

#### Loop 3: The Shareable Moment Loop

User gets Year-End Wrapped → Shares to Instagram/TikTok → Friends see it → "What app is this?" → Download

This is your awareness/brand loop. Doesn't directly invite, but creates curiosity.

**Shareable moments to build:**
- Year-End Wrapped
- Event memories ("Our 2026 adventures" compilation)
- "We've hung out X times" friendship stats
- Surprise reveal ("Look what my friends planned for me!")

---

### Specific Tactics

#### 1. Onboarding Push to Invite

Right after tutorial, before they get stuck in an empty app:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🎉 Ready to lock in your first plan │
│                                     │
│ Create a group with your go-to crew │
│                                     │
│ [Create Group]                      │
│                                     │
│ Skip for now                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

If they tap "Create Group":
1. Name the group
2. **Immediately** prompt to invite (don't let them create empty group and leave)
3. Open share sheet with pre-written message

**Pre-written invite message:**

"I'm using LockItIn to plan hangouts - join my group so we can find times that work for everyone 🗓️ [link]"

Short, explains value, and has a link.

---

#### 2. Invite Incentive (Optional)

**Free approach:**
- "Invite 3 friends who join → Unlock [something]"
- Could be: custom group icons, extra template use, profile badge

**Premium approach:**
- "Invite 5 friends who join → Get 1 month premium free"
- They get value, you get 5 potential paying users

**My take:** Start without incentives. See if natural virality is enough. Add incentives later if growth stalls.

---

#### 3. Make Invites Feel Personal

Generic: "Join me on LockItIn"
Better: "Join **College Crew** on LockItIn"
Best: "**Sarah** invited you to **College Crew** - 5 friends planning hangouts together"

**Invite link preview should show:**
- Who invited them (with profile photo)
- Group name (or event name)
- Member count or attendee count
- One line of what LockItIn does

---

#### 4. The "Empty Group" Nudge

If someone creates a group but doesn't invite anyone:

**Day 1:** "Your group is looking lonely! Invite friends to start planning."

**Day 3:** "Still just you in [Group Name]. LockItIn works best with friends - invite your crew!"

**Day 7:** "Last chance! Groups with no members get archived. [Invite Friends]"

(Don't actually archive it - but the nudge creates urgency)

---

#### 5. Year-End Wrapped Virality

This is your big annual moment. Make it shareable:

**What to include:**
- Total events attended
- Favorite group (most hangouts)
- Friend you saw most
- Longest streak of weekly hangouts
- Photo memories highlights
- Fun superlatives

**Shareable format:**
- Instagram Story sized cards (9:16)
- Multiple slides they can swipe through
- Branded but not obnoxious (small LockItIn logo)
- "Get your Wrapped" CTA at the end for viewers

**Timing:** First week of January, when everyone's nostalgic

## Pre-Launch Marketing

### Landing Page

**Simple page at `lockitin.app`:**

- Hero: "Lock in plans, not details."
- 3-4 feature highlights with visuals
- Email signup: "Get early access"
- Social links

#### Why Email List Matters

- Launch day you blast everyone
- They're already warm/interested
- Can give early access to beta testers

#### Landing Page Assets

**Proof of concept is enough:**
- Mockups/wireframes (even rough ones)
- Feature illustrations (icons or simple graphics)
- Just words (strong headline + bullets + signup)

**Look at how big apps did it:**
- Superhuman: Just landing page and waitlist, no product shots
- Many apps: Use illustrated mockups, not real screenshots

Build the landing page in a weekend, don't overthink it.

---

### Social Media Strategy

**You have @lockitin on Instagram and TikTok.**

**Content ideas:**
- Behind-the-scenes of building the app
- "Problems LockItIn solves" skits (the 47 messages to plan one thing)
- Feature previews
- Memes about group planning struggles
- Countdown to launch

**TikTok is probably your best bet:**
- Younger audience (your target)
- Organic reach still possible
- "Relatable group chat struggles" content does well

---

### Beta Tester Recruitment

#### Phase 1: Inner Circle (February)

- 10-20 people you know personally
- Focus on bug finding, basic UX feedback
- TestFlight
- Incentive: Free premium for 1 year + exclusive badge

#### Phase 2: Expanded Beta (March)

- 50-100 users from email list
- Real-world usage patterns
- Stress test the backend
- Incentive: Free premium for 1 year + early feature access

#### Phase 3: Public Launch (April)

- App Store live
- Email blast
- Social push
- PR if you can get it

---

### Launch Day Tactics

#### Coordinate a "Group Launch"

- Ask beta testers to all post about it on launch day
- Give them pre-made assets (screenshots, captions)
- Creates a wave effect on social

#### Product Hunt

- Submit on launch day
- Can drive significant downloads if you hit front page
- Prep assets in advance (logo, description, screenshots)

#### Reddit

- r/apps, r/iphone, r/productivity
- Don't spam - genuine "I built this" posts can do well
- Be ready to answer questions

#### Local Huntsville Push

- Tell everyone you know
- Local news/blogs might cover "local developer launches app"
- Huntsville tech community (any meetups, Slack groups?)

### What to Track Now (Pre-Launch)

**Simple approach:** When users sign up or set their home location, store the city/metro area. Run reports monthly.

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|-----------------|
| Signups by city/zip | Know where to launch business features |
| Active users by city | Signups mean nothing if they're not using it |
| Events created by location | High event activity = engaged users = attractive to businesses |
| "What should we do?" moments | Demand signal for business discovery features |

---

### Analytics Setup

**Tools to implement:**
- PostHog or Mixpanel for product analytics
- Amplitude for cohort analysis
- Stripe for payment tracking
- Xcode Organizer for crash reports

**Core dashboard should track:**
- Daily/weekly/monthly active users
- Retention curves by cohort
- Conversion to premium by signup date
- Revenue by subscription type
- Churn and LTV

## Revenue Projections

### Conservative Scenario

```
Month 1 (April 2026):
├─ Downloads: 500
├─ Active users: 200
└─ Premium conversions: 5
└─ Revenue: $25/month

Month 3 (June 2026):
├─ 1,000 active users
├─ 5% conversion = 50 paying
└─ Revenue: $250/month ($3,000/year)

Month 6 (September 2026):
├─ 5,000 active users
├─ 8% conversion = 400 paying
└─ Revenue: $2,000/month ($24,000/year)

Month 12 (April 2026):
├─ 15,000 active users
├─ 10% conversion = 1,500 paying
└─ Revenue: $7,500/month ($90,000/year)
```

---

### Optimistic Scenario

```
Month 6 (September 2026):
├─ 10,000 active users
├─ 10% conversion = 1,000 paying
└─ Revenue: $5,000/month ($60,000/year)

Month 12 (April 2026):
├─ 30,000 active users
├─ 12% conversion = 3,600 paying
└─ Revenue: $18,000/month ($216,000/year)
```

---

### B2B Revenue (When Launched - 6-12 months post-consumer launch)

```
Conservative (1 city):
├─ 100 businesses
├─ 60 Starter × $29 = $1,740
├─ 30 Growth × $79 = $2,370
├─ 10 Unlimited × $199 = $1,990
└─ Total: $6,100/month

Optimistic (5 cities):
├─ 500 businesses
└─ Total: $30,500/month
```

---

### Combined Revenue Year 2

**If business features launch in September 2026:**

```
Consumer revenue: $10,000+/month
B2B revenue: $5,000-15,000/month (growing)
───────────────────────────────
Total: $15,000-25,000+/month
```

---

### Key Assumptions

- 5-12% conversion to premium is achievable with good product
- Annual subscriptions will represent 20-30% of revenue
- No paid user acquisition (organic growth only)
- Churn stays below 5% monthly
- B2B will launch when a city hits 200-500 MAU

---

### Financial Reality Check

**Break-even analysis:**
- Supabase hosting: ~$50-100/month at 50K users
- Apple takes 30% (year 1) or 15% (year 2+)
- So $7,500/month revenue = $4,200 net at year 1

**Timeline to sustainability:**
- Month 6: Likely break-even or profitable
- Month 12: Solid sustainable business
- Month 18-24: If B2B launches, significant scale

---

## Decision Summary

| Decision | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| When to launch business features | 6-12 months post-consumer launch |
| How to know when | Track user location, launch when a city hits 200+ MAU |
| First business market | Likely Huntsville (your home turf) |
| What to build in MVP | Just location tracking (city on signup) |
| Business beta approach | Free/discounted access to first venues, learn and iterate |
| Consumer pricing | $4.99/month or $39.99/year (7-day trial) |
| Free tier limit | 3 groups max |
| Target conversion | 8-12% to premium |
| Launch tactics | Beta waves + Product Hunt + Twitter + Reddit |
| Marketing approach | Organic growth first, paid UA if/when PMF validated |
