## Product Vision & Mission

### Vision Statement

**We're building the calendar app that makes group event planning effortless.**

In a world where coordinating a simple dinner with friends requires 20+ messages scattered across group chats, we're creating a solution that:

- Shows real availability from actual calendars
- Makes proposing and voting on times visual and fun
- Respects privacy while enabling coordination
- Turns chaos into confirmed events automatically

**Our North Star:** If planning group events feels like work, we haven't succeeded.

### Mission Statement

LockItIn empowers friends to coordinate together without the friction, anxiety, and FOMO of traditional group chats and outdated scheduling tools. We believe coordination should be:

- **Private-first** - Share only what you choose
- **Visual** - See availability, not messages
- **Effortless** - One tap to vote, minutes to plan
- **Reliable** - Events that actually happen, memories that last

### Core Tagline

**"Lock in plans, not details."**

This captures our philosophy: We care deeply about confirming *when* things happen, but not about micromanaging the *what*. Your availability, your privacy, your control.

**Behavior:**
- Organizes 2-4 friend group events per month (8-10 people typically)
- Uses Apple Calendar as core tool for managing time
- Primary organizer for her social circle
- Frustrated by group chat coordination overhead
- Willing to pay for tools that save time
- Influences friend group's app adoption

**Pain Points:**

- Often invited to events, doesn't always respond

**Pain Points:**
- Forgets to check group chat
- Overwhelmed by back-and-forth messages
- Wants to participate but planning feels like a chore

**Goals:**
- See proposals and vote with minimal friction
- Get reminder when it's time to go
- No need to manage the planning itself

**Why They'll Use LockItIn:**
- Voting is literally one tap
- Works without needing to manage calendar imports
- Notifications remind them to respond

### Tertiary Persona: "Jordan the Privacy-Conscious"

**Profile:**
- Age: 25-40
- Cares deeply about privacy
- Wants to help friends but shares personal calendar selectively

**Pain Points:**
- Doesn't want to share all calendar details with friends
- Worried about surveillance or privacy breaches
- Needs granular control over what gets shared

**Goals:**
- Share only "busy" status, not event details
- Choose different privacy levels for different groups
- Feel confident their data is secure

**Why They'll Use LockItIn:**
- Privacy controls are core to the design
- Can share "busy" without event details (Shadow Calendar)
- No ads, no data selling, privacy-first philosophy

---

## Core Value Propositions

### 1. Privacy-First Availability Sharing (Shadow Calendar System)

**What:** Users can share calendar availability with groups without revealing private event details.

**How:** Three-tier privacy model:
- **Private** - Hidden from all groups
- **Shared with name** - Groups see event title & time
- **Busy only** - Groups see only "busy" block without details

**Why it matters:**
- People want to help coordinate but don't want everyone knowing their business
- Doctor appointments, therapy, personal time stays private
- Work commitments can be "busy" without explaining them
- Different groups get different visibility levels

**Differentiator:** No other app lets you coordinate while maintaining this level of privacy control.

### 2. Visual Group Availability & "Find Best Times"

**What:** See when friends are free with a beautiful heatmap, instantly understand overlaps.

**How:**
- Group heatmap shows availability across time slots
- Colors: green = everyone free, red = most busy
- Tap any slot to see who specifically is available
- "Find best times" algorithm suggests top 3 slots

**Why it matters:**
- Faster than reading messages ("Sarah can do Thursday or Saturday... wait, did Mike say yes?")
- Visual clarity prevents miscommunication
- Smart suggestions save 30+ minutes of planning
- Shows exactly who's conflicting, enabling quick problem-solving

**Differentiator:** Doodle shows availability as a grid (boring). LockItIn shows it as a heatmap (visual delight).

### 3. One-Tap Voting on Multiple Time Options

**What:** Create 2-5 time proposals, friends vote with literally one tap per option.

**How:**
1. Sarah creates proposal with 3 time options
2. Friends get notification
3. Each friend taps Available/Maybe/Can't Make It
4. Votes tally in real-time
5. Winner auto-confirms event

**Why it matters:**
- Eliminates "30 messages to plan one thing" problem
- Everyone sees the same information simultaneously
- Real-time vote updates create satisfaction
- Automatic confirmation saves final back-and-forth

**Differentiator:** Doodle/When2Meet make voting feel slow and manual. LockItIn makes it feel instant and alive.

### 4. Real-Time, Auto-Confirmed Events

**What:** When voting concludes or organizer confirms, event automatically adds to everyone's calendar.

**How:**
- System tracks votes
- When clear winner emerges (>50% availability) or deadline passes, event confirms
- Apple Calendar updated instantly for all attendees
- Everyone gets a celebratory notification

**Why it matters:**
- No ambiguity ("Did we decide Saturday or not?")
- No one has to manually add to their calendar
- Organizer doesn't have to send a final confirmation message
- Attendees see it's locked in (commitment signal)

**Differentiator:** Most scheduling tools require manual event creation. LockItIn automates it.

### 5. Built-In Network Effects (Group Coordination)

**What:** App requires friends to be on it to provide value.

**How:**
- Users create groups with their friends
- Each group member invited needs the app
- Value increases with each person who joins
- Invitation is the default action, not an afterthought

**Why it matters:**
- Natural viral loop (can't use app without inviting friends)
- Once a group is "on" LockItIn, everyone benefits
- Switching costs are high (group would need to find new tool)
- Word-of-mouth is organic and powerful

**Differentiator:** Solo users get zero value. Groups are the unit of adoption.

### 6. Delightful, Calm User Experience

**What:** Planning feels effortless, not stressful.

**How:**
- Minimal interface, one action per screen
- Smooth animations and haptic feedback
- Confetti when events confirm
- No FOMO, no guilt trips
- Privacy respected by default

**Why it matters:**
- Planning should feel fun, not like work
- Competing tools are stressful (Howbout, calendar apps)
- Emotional design creates habit formation
- Users feel respected, not manipulated

**Differentiator:** Most apps maximize engagement through FOMO and notifications. LockItIn feels supportive, not pushy.

## The Problem We Solve

### Current State is Broken

**The Group Chat Nightmare:**

```
Friend 1: "When should we do game night?"
Friend 2: "I'm free Thursday or Saturday"
Friend 3: "Can't do Thursday"
Friend 4: "What time Saturday?"
Friend 1: "Maybe 7pm?"
Friend 5: "I work until 8"
Friend 2: "Actually I forgot I have dinner Thursday"
[20 messages later...]
Friend 1: "Okay so... what did we decide?"
```

This is the lived experience for millions of people trying to coordinate friend events.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Doodle/When2Meet** - Not connected to real calendars, manual availability entry, no notifications
- **Calendly** - Built for business-to-person meetings, not friend groups, requires one person managing availability
- **Apple/Google Calendar** - No group coordination features, can't propose multiple times, sharing is all-or-nothing
- **Group chat + Calendar** - Scattered information, no visual overview, high friction to respond

### The Real Cost

- **Events don't happen** - Coordination failure means the plan falls apart
- **Hours wasted** - Planning overhead becomes the biggest friction point
- **Frustration kills spontaneity** - People stop suggesting hangouts
- **Organizer burnout** - One person bears all the burden
- **Attendees disengage** - Harder to confirm participation (they're tired of messages)

### Market Evidence

- Interviewed 15+ potential users - all confirmed "30 messages" problem
- User testing showed high frustration with existing tools
- Howbout (competitor) raised $8M (proof of market opportunity)
- iOS 17 adoption high (enables real-time features)
- Gen Z/Millennials value experiences over things (larger addressable market)

## Our Solution

### The Innovation: Availability-Aware Group Coordination

**The Magic Moment:**

1. Sarah wants to plan Secret Santa with 8 friends
2. She opens LockItIn, selects "College Friends" group
3. She sees a visual heatmap of when everyone is free (green = free, red = busy)
4. She proposes 3 weekend time slots with one tap
5. Friends get notified, vote with one tap each (Available/Maybe/No)
6. Votes update in real-time, best time highlighted
7. When voting closes, event auto-creates in everyone's calendar
8. Attendees get celebratory confirmation

**Time saved:** 45 minutes → 2 minutes
**Messages sent:** 30+ → 0
**Success rate:** 60% → 95%

### Core Architecture

**Four pillars of the product:**

1. **Personal Calendar** (Foundation)
   - Apple Calendar sync (read events, write proposed events)
   - Create/edit/delete events with privacy controls
   - Multiple calendar views (day, week, month)
   - Beautiful, native iOS interface

2. **Shadow Calendar** (Differentiation)
   - Users choose privacy level per event
   - Groups see aggregated availability, not private details
   - Enforced at database level for security
   - Respects user control

3. **Group Coordination** (Core Value)
   - Create friend groups and invite others
   - Propose events with 2-5 time options
   - Visual availability heatmap for groups
   - One-tap voting, real-time results
   - Auto-confirmation and calendar sync

4. **Notifications & Engagement** (Retention)
   - Smart notifications (only when action needed)
   - Real-time vote updates
   - Photo memories from events
   - Year-end wrapped recap

### Our Competitive Advantages

1. **Only app with calendar-connected group availability view**
   - Unique UX (heatmap vs grid)
   - Fastest way to see group availability
   - Powered by real calendar data

2. **Native iOS experience**
   - Competitors are web-based or desktop-first
   - Apple Calendar integration is seamless
   - Performance is superior
   - Notifications work better

3. **Built for friend groups, not businesses**
   - Simpler use case than Calendly (1-on-1 only)
   - Deeper coordination than Howbout (event creation automation)
   - Privacy-focused (unlike public event platforms)

4. **Privacy-first design**
   - Users choose what to share with whom
   - Granular per-event privacy controls
   - Shadow calendar respects autonomy
   - No tracking, no ads, no data selling

5. **Real-time collaboration**
   - Vote counts update live
   - Exciting, engaging experience
   - Creates social energy
   - Faster decisions

6. **Better pricing**
   - $4.99/mo vs Calendly ($12/mo)
   - Free tier is genuinely useful (not a crippled trial)
   - Annual option includes 33% discount

### Why Existing Solutions Don't Cut It

**The Gap:**

- **Doodle/When2Meet** - Manual entry, disconnected from calendars, zero network effects
- **Calendly** - Business-focused, one-to-many only, doesn't show group availability
- **Apple Calendar** - No multi-option voting, sharing is crude
- **Google Calendar** - Same as Apple
- **Howbout** - Gets close, but: pay-to-use groups, social network distraction, no privacy controls
- **Group Chat** - The default today but requires work to implement coordination

**The Opportunity:**

No one is optimizing for "groups of friends wanting to coordinate efficiently with privacy controls." That's the gap LockItIn fills.

## Market Positioning

### Positioning Statement

**For:** Young professionals (22-32) who organize friend group events

**Who need:** A way to quickly coordinate availability with their friend groups

**LockItIn is:** The only mobile-first app that syncs with real calendars, shows group availability visually, and lets everyone vote on times simultaneously—all while respecting privacy.

**Unlike:** Doodle (manual and slow), Howbout (social network bloat), or group chat (chaos)

**Our app:** Makes planning feel effortless because everyone can see when each person is free, vote once, and move on.

### Market Size (TAM/SAM/SOM)

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):** ~2B people globally who organize group events

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM):**
- iOS users (US + developed markets): 300M
- Age 18-40: 150M
- Organize events occasionally: 100M

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM - Year 2):**
- Conservative: 500K MAU
- Optimistic: 2M MAU

### Target Market Segments

**Segment 1: College/Young Professionals (Highest Priority)**
- Age 20-28
- Urban areas, college towns
- High propensity for social events
- Tech-savvy early adopters
- **Go-to-market:** Campus influencers, word-of-mouth

**Segment 2: Hobby/Club Communities**
- Board game groups
- Fitness groups
- Book clubs
- **Go-to-market:** Community apps, subreddits

**Segment 3: Family & Extended Friend Groups**
- Age 25-40
- Organizing family hangouts, cousin groups
- Larger groups (10-20 people)
- **Go-to-market:** Premium tier, family features (Year 2)

### Go-to-Market Strategy (Phase 1: Consumer Focus)

**Year 1 (2026): Organic Growth**
1. Launch on App Store (April 1)
2. Day 1: Product Hunt + Twitter + Reddit
3. Viral loop: Users invite friends naturally (can't use without them)
4. Beta testers promote to their friend groups
5. Free tier drives adoption

**No paid user acquisition Year 1.**

Why?
- Network effects do the work (friends invite friends)
- CAC would be too high relative to $4.99 subscription
- Organic growth proves product-market fit before spending

### Brand Positioning

**Tone:** Calm, helpful, respectful of user autonomy

**Not:**
- Chaotic or FOMO-inducing (unlike Snapchat, TikTok)
- Corporate or stiff (unlike Calendly)
- Bloated with features (unlike Facebook Events)
- Privacy-violating (unlike Instagram)

**Yes:**
- Supportive and enabling
- Minimalist and focused
- Respectful and private
- Fun but not obnoxious

**Brand Story:**
We built this because we were that friend constantly sending "When can everyone do...?" messages. We got tired of it. So we built a tool that respects everyone's time and privacy while making coordination effortless.

## Product Strategy & Roadmap

### Phase 1: Friend Groups First (MVP - Year 1, April 2026)

**Why start with friend groups?**

1. **Network effects work better with private groups** - Every new user brings 5-10 friends
2. **Privacy is core differentiator** - Matters more in friend contexts than public events
3. **Less competition** - Howbout is too bloated, others too simplistic
4. **Faster validation** - Simpler problem space, clearer success metrics
5. **Better unit economics** - Low CAC (organic), high LTV (subscription)

**MVP Feature Set:**
- Personal calendar with Apple Calendar sync
- Shadow Calendar privacy system
- Friend system and group creation
- Group availability heatmap
- Event proposals with real-time voting
- Auto-event creation
- Push notifications
- Surprise Birthday template
- Potluck/Friendsgiving template
- Travel time calculations

**Success Metrics (Year 1):**
- 500+ downloads by Day 1
- 200+ active users by Month 1
- 5,000+ active users by Month 6
- 8-12% conversion to premium
- $2,500+ monthly recurring revenue by Month 6

### Phase 2: Retention & Engagement (Year 1, Post-Launch)

**Focus:** Keep users coming back after they've planned their first event

**Features:**
- BeReal-style photo capture after events
- Photo sharing albums
- Year-End Wrapped recap
- Seasonal event templates (Beach Day, Halloween, Secret Santa, etc.)

**Why this matters:**
- Planning is the promise (why they download)
- Memories are the surprise (why they stay)

### Phase 3: Business Events Discovery (Year 2+, 6-12 months post-consumer launch)

**Concept:** Add "Discover" tab showing local business events

**Why later?**
1. Validate consumer product first (don't want to confuse the offering)
2. Understand user base geography (where are concentrations?)
3. Need critical mass to attract businesses (200-500+ MAU per city)
4. Build business features once consumer is stable

**Business Value:**
- New revenue stream ($6K+/month per city)
- Network effects amplify (more reasons to open app)
- Enables future expansion (public events, ticketing, etc.)

**Trigger:** When a city hits 200-500 monthly active users, start B2B outreach in that market.

### Phase 4: Platform Expansion (Year 2-3)

**Future possibilities (only if successful):**
- Android app
- Google Calendar / Outlook integration
- Recurring availability patterns
- Calendar widgets
- Web app for event discovery

**Not doing Year 1:**
- Paid user acquisition
- Ads or tracking
- Data selling
- Complex AI/ML
- International localization
- Business or work features

---

## Strategic Principles

### Product Development Philosophy

1. **Privacy-first, always**
   - Default to private, require explicit sharing
   - Never sell data
   - Transparency about what we collect
   - User control over all settings

2. **Simplicity over features**
   - One primary action per screen
   - Defer features to V1.1+ if they add complexity
   - No feature bloat
   - Each feature must solve a real problem

3. **Calendar-aware**
   - Everything ties to Apple Calendar
   - Respect existing calendar behavior
   - Don't fight the native calendar, extend it
   - Sync is bidirectional or not at all

4. **Network effects first**
   - Design for groups, not individuals
   - Inviting friends is the primary action
   - Value increases with each member
   - Naturally viral

5. **Calm, not chaotic**
   - Notifications only when action needed
   - No FOMO weaponization
   - No gamification or leaderboards
   - No algorithmic feeds

### Feature Evaluation Framework

**For every proposed feature, ask:**

**Does this help groups coordinate when/where to meet?**

If yes: Consider it.
If no: Reject it (even if cool).

**Examples:**

✅ Event memories (people want to remember events they attended)
✅ Smart time suggestions (helps groups decide faster)
✅ Travel time alerts (practical utility)
❌ Social feed (FOMO machine, not about coordination)
❌ User profiles (not necessary for coordination)
❌ Chat in-app (that's what group chat is for)
❌ Sponsorships (breaks privacy promise)

### Decision-Making Criteria

When evaluating features, prioritize:

1. **Solves real problem** - User research confirms this is painful
2. **MVP-ready** - Can ship in 1-2 weeks without refactoring
3. **Enhances privacy** - Doesn't compromise user autonomy
4. **Drives retention** - Keeps users coming back
5. **Network effect** - Makes the app more valuable with more users

### What We Will NOT Build

**Year 1 (Post-MVP):**
- Android app (iOS validates first)
- Google Calendar / Outlook integration (Apple Calendar first)
- Recurring availability patterns (future premium feature)
- Advanced search/filters (not needed for small groups)
- Event templates (save for seasonal updates)
- Team/work features (would dilute brand)
- Public events (separate product)
- Calendar widgets (native limitations)

**Why:** These either:
- Add complexity before validating core loop
- Distract from privacy/focus philosophy
- Require significant engineering for marginal benefit
- Don't align with friend group use case

**The Focus:** Perfect the friend group coordination loop first. Everything else is secondary.

### What NOT to Do

❌ **Ads** - Ruins UX, destroys brand
❌ **Sell user data** - Contradicts privacy promise
❌ **Nickel-and-diming** - Pay-per-event creates friction
❌ **Aggressive upselling** - Annoys users, drives uninstalls
❌ **Freemium trials** - Free tier IS the product, not a trial

---

## Long-Term Vision (3-5 Years)

### Year 2: Scaling & Retention

**Consumer:**
- Improve retention with event memories
- Seasonal event templates (every 3 months)
- Recurring availability patterns
- Family/household coordination

**B2B:**
- Discover tab in 3-5 cities
- Business event discovery
- RSVP tracking for businesses
- Analytics for venue owners

**Revenue target:** $50K+/month (consumer + B2B combined)

### Year 3-5: Expansion & Network

**International Expansion:**
- Launch in Canada, UK, Australia
- Localization support
- Time zone management

**Platform Expansion:**
- Android app (proven iOS success)
- Web app for event discovery
- Calendar integrations (Google, Outlook)
- Smart home integration ("Alexa, what time is game night?")

**Feature Expansion:**
- Travel event coordination
- Expense splitting
- Photo sharing at scale
- AI-powered scheduling

**Revenue target:** $500K+/month (10K+ paying customers)

### The Endgame Vision

**LockItIn as the social layer for calendar coordination:**

Not a social network (no feed, no FOMO).
Not a business tool (no meetings, no work).

But the app that makes spontaneous friend coordination *feel good* again.

From "30 messages to plan one thing" to "everyone's available at 7pm Saturday, locked in."

**Future possibilities:**
- Public event discovery powered by friend groups
- Travel planning for groups
- Expense management between friends
- Integration with event ticketing
- Group gift pooling

But only if we stay focused on the core use case first.

## Success Metrics

### Year 1 Targets (MVP Launch)

**Month 1 (April 2026):**
- 500+ downloads
- 200+ active users
- 50+ active groups
- 100+ events created
- 40%+ Day-7 retention
- 4.0+ App Store rating
- 5+ press mentions

**Month 3 (June 2026):**
- 1,000+ active users
- 25%+ Day-30 retention
- 50 paying users (5% conversion)
- $250+ MRR
- 4.5+ App Store rating
- NPS score: 40+

**Month 6 (September 2026):**
- 5,000+ active users
- 35%+ Day-30 retention
- 400 paying users (8% conversion)
- $2,000+ MRR
- Product-market fit signals
- NPS score: 50+

### Product-Market Fit Signals

We'll know we have PMF when:

1. **Users invite friends naturally** (K-factor >1.0)
2. **Day-30 retention >35%** (indicates sticky product)
3. **Conversion to premium >8%** (willingness to pay proven)
4. **NPS >50** (customers recommend to others)
5. **Organic growth >20% week-over-week** (viral loop working)
6. **Usage >2 events/user/month** (habits forming)

### North Star Metric

**"Events Successfully Planned Per User Per Month"**

This is the one metric that matters most. Not DAU, not MAU, not conversion rate.

If users are organizing multiple events per month with their friend groups, we've won.

Target: 2+ events/user/month by Month 6

## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Market Risks

**Risk: Users don't care about calendar sync**
- Many people aren't organized with calendars
- Mitigation: Conduct pre-launch user testing with target audience
- Fallback: Add manual availability entry as backup
- Action: Track calendar import rate in beta, adjust if <30%

**Risk: Network effects don't work**
- Entire user group needs app for value (high barrier)
- Mitigation: Make free tier compelling for individuals (personal calendar)
- Fallback: Add solo-useful features (personal calendar, travel time alerts)
- Action: Monitor viral coefficient (K-factor) early, iterate if <0.5

**Risk: Adoption is too slow**
- Competes with incumbents (Apple Cal, group chat)
- Mitigation: Heavy emphasis on Year 1 user research and feedback
- Fallback: Pivot to higher-friction groups first (sports teams, clubs)
- Action: Track weekly growth rate, adjust marketing if <10% WoW

### Competitive Risks

**Risk: Howbout improves significantly**
- Howbout already has funding ($8M+), larger team
- Mitigation: Execute faster, focus on privacy differentiation
- Fallback: Position as "Howbout + privacy controls"
- Action: Monitor Howbout's roadmap quarterly, be ready to pivot

**Risk: Apple launches calendar coordination features**
- Apple could crush startups in calendar space
- Mitigation: Privacy-first brand is distinct from Apple
- Fallback: Become third-party extension to Apple Calendar
- Action: Build on Supabase not proprietary infrastructure, stay portable

### Execution Risks

**Risk: Solo developer pace is unsustainable**
- Estimated 3-4 hours/day for 6 months is optimistic
- Illness, burnout could derail timeline
- Mitigation: Pre-build heavy documentation, use no-code where possible
- Fallback: Hire contract help for non-core features
- Action: Build in 2-week buffer in timeline, monitor energy levels

**Risk: Apple Review rejects the app**
- Privacy claims could draw Apple's scrutiny
- Mitigation: Be conservative, don't make claims we can't back
- Fallback: Build web version as alternative distribution
- Action: Pre-review with developer community, iterate before submission

**Risk: Supabase pricing scales unexpectedly**
- If millions of events created, Supabase bills could spike
- Mitigation: Monitor costs monthly, optimize queries early
- Fallback: Migrate to self-hosted PostgreSQL if needed
- Action: Set up cost alerts, track cost per user monthly

### Product Risks

**Risk: Privacy model confuses users**
- Three-tier system (Private/Shared/Busy-Only) might be too complex
- Mitigation: Extensive UX testing pre-launch, clear defaults
- Fallback: Simplify to two tiers (Private/Shared)
- Action: Test with 50+ users during beta, adjust if >20% confusion

**Risk: Real-time voting creates social pressure**
- Seeing votes come in might create negative social dynamics
- Mitigation: Don't show who voted what (show aggregates only)
- Fallback: Make vote visibility optional per group
- Action: Gather user feedback during beta, monitor group sentiment

### Financial Risks

**Risk: Monetization is lower than projected**
- Users might not convert at 8-12% rate
- Mitigation: Start with 5% conversion target, exceed it
- Fallback: Add B2B features sooner, pursue business licensing
- Action: Track conversion rate daily, analyze churn cohorts

**Risk: Supabase and APNs costs are higher than estimated**
- Infrastructure costs might erode profitability
- Mitigation: Optimize push notifications, batch database queries
- Fallback: Self-host if costs exceed $500/month
- Action: Monitor burn rate, adjust feature development if needed

## Summary

LockItIn solves a real, painful problem: the 30-message coordination nightmare.

We do this by:
1. **Syncing real calendars** (Apple Calendar integration)
2. **Showing group availability visually** (heatmap, not messages)
3. **Making voting instant** (one tap per option)
4. **Creating events automatically** (no final back-and-forth)
5. **Respecting privacy** (granular controls, Shadow Calendar)

Our strategy is:
1. **Launch consumer product for friend groups** (April 2026)
2. **Validate product-market fit** (reach 5K MAU by Month 6)
3. **Expand to B2B** (discover tab, business events) (6-12 months post-launch)
4. **Scale nationally and internationally** (Year 2-3+)

Our competitive advantage is:
- Only app with real calendar sync + group availability + voting
- Native iOS experience
- Privacy-first design
- Network effects built-in
- Better pricing than competitors

Success looks like:
- 5,000+ active users by Month 6
- 8-12% premium conversion
- $2,000+ MRR by Month 6
- 2+ events/user/month engagement
- Product-market fit confirmed

This is an ambitious but achievable goal for a solo developer with the right product-market fit.
