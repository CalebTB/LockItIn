## Quick Reference: Your Tax Obligations

### Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments (Form 1040-ES)

**When to Pay:**
- Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar): Due April 15, 2026
- Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun): Due June 15, 2026
- Q3 2026 (Jul-Sep): Due September 15, 2026
- Q4 2026 (Oct-Dec): Due January 15, 2027

**How Much to Set Aside:**
Set aside **30% of net profit** each month as a safe estimate:
- Federal income tax: ~12-22% (depends on your total income)
- Self-employment tax: 15.3% (Social Security + Medicare)
- State tax: 0-10% (depends on your state)

**Example Calculation:**
```
Month 5 (Aug 2026):
Net Revenue: $733.53
Expenses: $55.48
Net Profit: $678.05
Tax Reserve (30%): $203.42 ← Move this to savings immediately
```

## What Counts as a Tax Deduction?

### Fully Deductible Business Expenses (Year of Purchase)

**Software & Services:**
- Apple Developer Account: $99/year
- Supabase subscription: $25-150/month
- Figma, analytics, email tools: Fully deductible
- Domain registration: $15/year

**Transaction Fees:**
- Stripe processing fees: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Bank fees for business account

**Marketing & Growth:**
- Email marketing (Mailchimp, etc.)
- Paid ads (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Influencer partnerships or sponsorships

**Professional Services:**
- Lawyer fees (privacy policy, terms of service)
- Accountant/CPA fees
- Contract developers or designers (must issue 1099 if >$600/year)

**Home Office (if applicable):**
- Simplified method: $5/sq ft, max 300 sq ft = $1,500/year
- Actual method: % of rent + utilities based on office square footage
- Example: 150 sq ft office / 1,000 sq ft apartment = 15% of rent/utilities

**Internet & Phone:**
- Deduct percentage used for business (be honest, typically 25-50%)
- Keep records showing business use

---

### Capital Expenses (Depreciated Over Time)

**Equipment (Section 179 Deduction Available):**
- Mac Mini ($699): Depreciate over 5 years = $140/year
- OR use Section 179 to deduct full amount in 2025 (year of purchase)
- iPhone for testing: 5-year depreciation or Section 179
- iPad/monitors: Same rules apply

**Section 179 Explanation:**
Lets you deduct the FULL cost of equipment in the year purchased (up to certain limits). Great for solo developers because it gives you a bigger deduction upfront instead of spreading over 5 years.

**When to Use Section 179:**
- If you want a bigger tax deduction in Year 1 (2025)
- If your total income is high enough to benefit from the deduction
- Talk to a CPA if uncertain

**Example:**
```
Without Section 179:
Mac Mini $699 → Deduct $140/year for 5 years

With Section 179:
Mac Mini $699 → Deduct full $699 in 2025
```

---

## What Does NOT Count as a Deduction?

**Personal Expenses (Even if you use them for work):**
- Personal laptop used occasionally for work (unless >50% business use)
- Personal streaming subscriptions (Netflix, Spotify, etc.)
- Groceries, clothing, personal travel
- 100% of phone/internet if you also use it personally

**Revenue Already Reduced:**
- Apple's 30% commission is NOT an expense you deduct separately
- It's already subtracted from your revenue (you only report NET revenue)
- Example: User pays $4.99 → Apple takes $1.50 → You report $3.49 as revenue

## When to Hire a CPA

**You should hire a tax professional when:**
- Annual revenue exceeds $50,000
- You're considering changing business structure (LLC, S-Corp)
- You hire employees or multiple contractors
- You expand to multiple states (sales tax complexity)
- You receive an IRS audit notice
- You want to optimize tax strategy (R&D credits, etc.)

**Cost Expectations:**
- Basic Schedule C tax prep: $300-600
- Monthly bookkeeping: $100-300/month
- Tax planning consultation: $150-300/hour

**Good Solo-Friendly CPAs:**
- Look for CPAs specializing in "freelancers" or "digital businesses"
- Ask: "Do you work with solo app developers?"
- Bonus: Find one who uses software you already use (QuickBooks, Wave, etc.)

## Business Structure Considerations

### Sole Proprietorship (Default - Where You Are Now)
**Pros:**
- Simple: No paperwork, just report on Schedule C
- Low cost: $0 to set up
- Works great for first $50K in revenue

**Cons:**
- You pay full self-employment tax (15.3%)
- No liability protection
- All profit is taxed as personal income

### LLC (Consider if Revenue >$50K/year)
**Pros:**
- Liability protection (personal assets protected)
- Still report on Schedule C (no change in taxes)
- Professional credibility

**Cons:**
- $50-800 setup cost (varies by state)
- Annual state fees ($0-$800/year)
- More paperwork

### S-Corporation (Consider if Revenue >$100K/year)
**Pros:**
- Pay yourself a "salary" + take "distributions"
- Only salary is subject to 15.3% self-employment tax
- Can save $5,000-15,000/year in taxes at higher revenue

**Cons:**
- Complex: Need payroll, quarterly filings
- CPA almost required ($2,000-5,000/year)
- Only worth it if you're making $100K+ net profit

**Recommendation for LockItIn:**
- **Year 1 (2026):** Stay sole proprietorship. Simple, low cost.
- **Year 2 (2027):** If revenue exceeds $50K, form an LLC for liability protection.
- **Year 3 (2028):** If revenue exceeds $100K, talk to CPA about S-Corp election.

## Common Tax Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not Setting Aside Tax Money**
   - Problem: Spend all revenue, can't pay quarterly taxes
   - Solution: Move 30% to savings immediately when revenue hits

2. **Mixing Personal & Business Expenses**
   - Problem: Can't track business expenses, audit risk
   - Solution: Get separate business credit card (even if sole prop)

3. **Missing Receipts**
   - Problem: IRS audits require proof, no receipt = no deduction
   - Solution: Screenshot/save receipts same day as purchase

4. **Not Paying Quarterly Taxes**
   - Problem: IRS penalties + interest (can be 3-5% of tax owed)
   - Solution: Pay estimated taxes every quarter, even if small

5. **Deducting 100% of Mixed-Use Expenses**
   - Problem: Audit red flag (claiming 100% of phone/internet when you use personally)
   - Solution: Be honest, deduct realistic percentage (25-50% typical)

6. **Forgetting About State Taxes**
   - Problem: Owe state taxes + penalties
   - Solution: Check your state's tax requirements (some states have no income tax!)

## Year 1 Estimated Tax Calculation

Based on your projections, here's what to expect:

**2026 Estimated Taxes:**
```
Q1 (Jan-Mar): $0 due (no revenue yet)
Q2 (Apr-Jun): ~$72 due Jun 15, 2026
Q3 (Jul-Sep): ~$711 due Sep 15, 2026
Q4 (Oct-Dec): ~$2,163 due Jan 15, 2027
Total 2026: ~$2,946
```

**Breakdown of Year 1 Taxes (Conservative Estimate):**
```
Total Net Profit 2026: $30,709
Less Standard Deduction: -$14,600 (2026 single filer)
Taxable Income: $16,109

Federal Income Tax (~12% bracket): $1,933
Self-Employment Tax (15.3% of profit): $4,699
State Tax (varies, assume 5%): $805
TOTAL TAX LIABILITY: ~$7,437

Less Quarterly Payments Made: -$2,946
Amount Due April 15, 2027: ~$4,491
```

**Key Insight:** You'll owe roughly $7,400 in taxes for Year 1, but only if you hit the conservative projections. Setting aside 30% monthly ($9,212 total) gives you a buffer.

## Tax Savings Opportunities

### R&D Tax Credit (Advanced - Talk to CPA)
Software development MAY qualify for R&D credits if you're:
- Developing new features or algorithms
- Solving technical challenges
- Creating innovative software

**Potential Savings:** $5,000-20,000 depending on development costs
**Complexity:** Requires detailed tracking of development time/expenses
**Recommendation:** Ask CPA in Year 2 if this applies to you

### Home Office Deduction
If you work from home exclusively (no other office):
- Simplified: $5/sq ft × office size (max 300 sq ft) = up to $1,500/year
- Actual: Calculate % of home used for business × (rent + utilities)

**Example:**
```
10' × 12' home office = 120 sq ft
Simplified deduction: 120 × $5 = $600/year
```

### Retirement Contributions (SEP-IRA or Solo 401k)
**Tax-Deferred Savings:**
- SEP-IRA: Contribute up to 25% of net profit (max $69,000 in 2025)
- Solo 401(k): Contribute up to $23,000 as "employee" + 25% as "employer"

**Example (Year 2, if profitable):**
```
Net Profit 2027: $50,000
SEP-IRA Contribution: $12,500 (25%)
Reduces Taxable Income: $50,000 → $37,500
Tax Savings: ~$4,000 (depending on bracket)
```

**Recommendation:** Consider in Year 2-3 when profitable and want to reduce tax burden.
