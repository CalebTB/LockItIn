# Issue Implementation Summaries

This directory contains detailed implementation summaries for each issue completed during the LockItIn app development.

## Purpose

Each issue should have a corresponding `ISSUE_X_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` file that documents:
- What was implemented
- Technical decisions made
- Files created/modified
- Testing instructions
- Known limitations
- Future enhancements

## Naming Convention

Files should follow this pattern:
- `ISSUE_9_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `ISSUE_10_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- etc.

## Instructions for Agents

**For flutter-architect and other implementation agents:**

When completing an issue implementation, always create a comprehensive implementation summary and place it in this directory (`lockitin_issueImplementation/`), NOT in the application folder.

**Location:** `E:\Claude\Shareless\Shareless-EverythingCalendar\lockitin_issueImplementation\`
